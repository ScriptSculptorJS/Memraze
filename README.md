## Motivation
I wanted to create an app where someone could store information about their interests, and be able to look back on it to see what may or may not have worked in the past. It allowed me to create authentication by utilizing tokens and storing them in the backend cookies and work with MongoDB.
## Built With
HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React, Bootstrap, MongoDB, JWT, Cookies

## Future Plans
1. Make it so the user can add a profile image and photos within a post.
2. Make it so they can see other user's profiles and tabs.
3. They can follow profiles or just tabs.
4. See those people and/or tabs in their left navbar that currently contains their tabs list so they can easily click the link to see them.
5. Can take it even further, but the main point is that if they follow a person or tab that user does not have to follow back. It is all very intentional.

## Project Status
Completed for now, but can be built upon in the future
