One of the 4 keepers was actually larger than the measurer. We took mom out to the long dock for her first time. We ventured around the shops and stopped at Granny's where dad and I bought some candy. We then grabbed a bite to eat at the Blackbeard's Brewery.`

While the cage was in the water I took him out to the large deck that many people use for fishing and crabbing. While we were on our way back to the car we saw a baby seal near the dock and crying for its momma. It was his first time out there. Then, we ate at Burnett's. Lastly, we took a drive over to check out the crandberry fields.`

That is when I noticed a long deck I have never been to before. I decided to walk over to it. When I got out further I noticed that one of the branches of the docks in Westport had many large seals or sea lions chilling and making lots of noise on it. I made it all the way to the end of the long deck and saw seals following a boat that was throwing out left over pieces of their catches from the day. I walked back into town and stopped at Blackbeard's Brewery to get their handcrafted rootbeer and some garlic fries. It was delicios. When I pulled the cage up I was able to take home 2 crab that was shared amongst dad, mom and I.`
